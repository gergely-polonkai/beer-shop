# BeerShop

All of the requested features are implemented.

The app's feature pages are individual moduls. I also created small common components.

I attempted to create the design as it was given in Figma.

At the last period before the deadline, I wrote some Unit tests for the services.   


## How to run

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.2.

To install all the dependencies, you must run `npm install`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
